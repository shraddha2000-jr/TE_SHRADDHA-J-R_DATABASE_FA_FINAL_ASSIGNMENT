Module 1: SQL Server:
1. Perform the normalization
a) Create tables as per normalization
b) Insert the data
c) Join the table
d) Create different views

Scenario:
1. Healthcare domain:
Multiple patients visiting hospitals located in multiple cities, for check up and treatment, multiple
doctors treating patients belong to specific department advising routine checkups(ex: Xray, Sugar
test, urine test, MRI etc) and further drugs(medicines) for the disease identified

Use Integration Services to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, loading data warehouses, cleansing and mining data, and managing SQL Server objects and data.*
Entry criteria: Transactions tables created in Module 1, task 2
1. Make connection to different data source ( Oracle DB, Flatfile, SQL Server )
2. Extract
3. Transform
4. Load to new target system - SQL Server
5. Perform SCD 1 &amp; SCD2 dimension table modelling
6. Create aggregate table based on the particular column( ex: Country code). Refer to the
different data source from target system

Module 3 SSRS:
*SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) provides a set of on-premises tools and services that create, deploy, and manage paginated reports.*
Entry criteria: The new target system - DWH is created in Module 2
1. Using the newly created DWH - SQL Server , generate different reports
a) Dashboard
b) Reports
Apply the filter on Dashboard and report level. Create meaningful reports
Ex: Sales forecast, Loanâ€™s overview etc

Module 4 IICS: 
*IICS is Informatica's data integration tool for the cloud. It provides users with an option for running Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes in the cloud instead of using traditional platforms like integration services on-premise.*
Entry criteria: Transactions tables created in Module 1, task 2
1. Make connection to different data source ( Oracle DB, Flat file, SQL Server )
2. Extract
3. Transform
4. Load to new target system - SQL Server
5. Perform SCD 1 &amp; SCD2 dimension table modelling
6. Create aggregate table based on the particular column( ex: Country code). Refer to the
different data source from target system
7. Create data replication task ( single table and FULL DB)
